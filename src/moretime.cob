        *> moretime.
        *> Takes: Standard arguments.
        *> Requests more time for the current round. First checks if the round is active
        *>   using roundstatus, and if it is, flags the player requesting more time.
        *>   Then checks if all players have flagged more time and if they have, grants
        *>   more time.
        *>   XXX This routine is severely non-thread safe. It is possible for two players
        *>   to click simultaneosly more time and enter InitMoreTime procedure simultaneously,
        *>   granting time twice.
        *>   A fix for this would be: - Get remaining round time.
        *>   - Check if time is less than 60 seconds and if it is, increment it by 120 seconds.
        *>   - Overwrite the old time in the database with this value, instead of adding to it.
        *>   This requires coding time operations in COBOL that are compatible with SQL.
