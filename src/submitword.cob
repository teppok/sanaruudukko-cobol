        *> Takes: Standard arguments + word.
        *> Checks if the current round is still going on and if it is, gets the current
        *>   board and calls checkword to see if the word is in the board. If it is,
        *>   queries wordlist (with Language='FI') and adds the word to the player's word list
        *>   possibly with Words.Languagecheck=true if it's in the list and false if it's not.
